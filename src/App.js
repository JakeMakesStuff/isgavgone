    <h3>Why should he resign?</h3>
    <p>Gavin Williamson's policies will have destroyed the lives of many young people. Whilst he did apologise for this, his fixes were too late and were after many people lost their university places.</p>

    <h3>Isn't this website a bit harsh?</h3>
    <p>He had every opportunity to change his course of actions to not destroy thousands of lives. With that said, all I personally want is for him to resign from his position since I believe his actions were too damaging for him to stay on.</p>

    <h3>Should I go and [do social media action to] him?</h3>
    <p><b>No.</b> This website is for informational and satirical purposes only. I do not condone any personal attacks. He only deserves to lose his position as anyone who failed at a job as badly as he did would have to in normal circumstances.</p>
